Nagoasong,

I'm supposing you installed pgbouncer in the CentOS 6 box. In this case, `/etc/init.d/pgbouncer` has:

```
        # Make sure startup-time log file is valid
        if [ ! -e "$BOUNCERLOG" -a ! -h "$BOUNCERLOG" ]
        then
                touch "$BOUNCERLOG" || exit 1
                chown pgbouncer:pgbouncer "$BOUNCERLOG"
                chmod go-rwx "$BOUNCERLOG"
                [ -x /usr/bin/chcon ] && /usr/bin/chcon -u system_u -r object_r -t postgresql_log_t "$BOUNCERLOG" 2>/dev/null
        fi

        mkdir -p $(dirname $pidfile)
        chown pgbouncer:pgbouncer $(dirname $pidfile)

        cd /
        daemon --user=pgbouncer --pidfile=$pidfile $exec -d -q $BOUNCERCONF
        retval=$?
```

This snippet is from the function `start()` which means that every start triggers an ownership change. In order to change the pgbouncer daemon user from pgbouncer to postgres, you have to modify the pgbouncer service file (/etc/init.d/pgbouncer) replacing chown entries and also the daemon --user=pgbouncer to daemon --user=postgres. After that, you must change the log directory owner with the following command:

chown -R postgres. /var/log/pgbouncer

If you observe issues, please share the errors from the pgbouncer.log.

Let me know if it works for you.

PS> did you solve the authentication issues?

Regards,
